Add a podcast-style summary feature to the app. It will use Azure Text-to-Speech to generate a narrated podcast for any uploaded text.

üéô Podcast Format (Fixed Structure):
The output audio should follow this structure:

Brief summary of the text

Discussion of its strengths and weaknesses

Explanation of what the reader might gain from the text, and what they may find difficult

Five representative (and high-quality) quotations from the text, read aloud clearly

üß† Content Generation:
Use the selected LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek) to generate the actual podcast 
script using the format above. Use the first 2,000‚Äì5,000 words of the document (or full text if short) as input. 
Save the final script as plain text.

üîä Text-to-Speech Rendering:
Use Microsoft Azure Speech to convert the podcast script into audio.

Use the following environment variables already defined in .env:

AZURE_SPEECH_KEY ‚Üí Azure API Key for Speech

AZURE_SPEECH_ENDPOINT ‚Üí Azure Region Endpoint (e.g., https://eastus.tts.speech.microsoft.com/)

Use a natural-sounding voice (e.g., en-US-JennyNeural or en-US-DavisNeural).

Output format should be MP3 or OGG, playable in the browser and downloadable.

üñº UI Requirements:
Add a ‚Äúüéß Generate Podcast‚Äù button next to the document viewer.

When clicked, generate the podcast, then show a play/pause audio interface.

Allow users to download the podcast audio file.

Display a preview of the podcast script under the player.

IMPORTANT: GIVE USERS TWO OPTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO PODCAST GENERATION: OPTION 1: THE USER CAN CHOOSE THE DEFAULT MODE; OPTION 2, THE USER CAN ENTER CUSTOMIZED INSTRUCTIONS (E.G. 
REWRITE AS A SNARKY DIALOGUE). THE DEFAULT MODE GENERATES A PODCAST THAT COVERS THE AREA HIGHLIGHTED (OR OTHERWISE SELECTED) BY THE USER THAT HAS THE FOLLOWING FORMAT: 
SUMMARY, ANALYSIS, POSSIBLE OBJECTIONS AND COUNTEROBJECTIONS, STRENGTHS, POSSIBLE CHALLENGES TO READER, AND REPRESENTATIVE QUOTATIONS.

‚ö†Ô∏è Paywall:
Restrict full podcast generation to registered users with credits. 
Unregistered users can see the podcast script preview (first 100 words) and hear a 30-second audio snippet only.
