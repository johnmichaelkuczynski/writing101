YOU NEVER WALL PEOPLE OUT OF THE SITE. USERS WHO ARE NOT REGISTERED HAVE ACCESS TO THE SITE. 
THEY CAN UPLOAD DOCUMENTS. 
THEY CAN ASK QUESTIONS. BUT THEY WILL ONLY GET PREVIEWS OF THE ANSWER. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? 
THEY WILL BE REAL PREIVEWS (AROUND 200 WORDS MAX), GENERATED BY LLM, BUT THEY WILL ONLY GET PREVIEWS. 
THEY WILL ALSO GET MESSAGES SAYING: IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY THIS APP'S SERVICES, KINDLY REGSITER AND BUY CREDITS.
 WHEN USERS REGSITER THEY DO NOT NEED TO USE EMAILS; JUST USERNAMES AND PASSWORDS; 
AND IF THEY DO CHOOSE TO USE EMAIL AS USERNAME, THERE IS NO EMAIL VERIFICATION. 
USERS WILL THEN BE DIRECTED TO A PLACE WHERE THEY BUY CREIDTS. THE PRICING TIERS ARE AS FOLLOWS: 
Pricing tiers: $5 →5,000 tokens $10 → 20,000 tokens $100 → 500,000 tokens $1,000 → 10,000,000 tokens . 
PURCHASES WILL BE MADE THROUGTH STRIPE: ALL CREDENTAILS IN ACCOUNT SECRETS 
(SECRET KEY, PUBLIC KEY, WEBHOOK....STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY STRIPE_SECRET_KEY STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_COGNITIVEPROFILER. 
AFTER USERS REGISTER AND BUY CREDITS, THEY HAVE ACCESS TO LONG TERM STORAGE. 
STORAGE IS CHARGED AT A RATE OF 500 TOKENS/MONTH FOR 50,000 WORDS. 
STORAGE FEES WOULD APPLY TO STORED ASSIGNMENTS AND STUDENT PAPERS AND THE LIKE. 
IF STORAGE FEES CAUSE USER TO RUKN OUT OF CREDITS, SIMPLY REMIND HIM WHEN HE NEXT LOGS IN. 
YOU MUST BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT STORAGE FEES; ALSO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THERE ARE NO STORAGE FEES 
UNLESS DOCUMENTS ARE STORED BETWEEN SESSIONS. ALL ACIVITIES THAT INVOLVE API CALLS IN THE APP ARE NOT FREE; 
TEH PERFECT ESSAY WRITER, THE GRADER, THE REWRITE, THE CHAT WITH APP---ALL OF THAT COMES OUT OF THE USER'S CREDITS.
 NEXT, YU MUST CREATE A NEON DATA BASE. USERS WILL HAVE ZERO ACCESS TO OTHER USER' RECORDS /ACTIVITY. 
SO ONE NEON DATABASE, BUT VARIOUS USERS WHO ARE INVISIBLE TO EACH OTHER. IF USER CREATES A NASSIGNMENT 
OR GENERATES A PAPER OR GRADES AN ASSIGNMENT, THAT HAS ZERO EFFECT ON OHTER UERS OR ON ACT ITSELF. 
FINALLY, GPTZERO IS OHLY FOR SUBCRIBED/PAID USERS. DEACTIVATE IT FOR UNREGISTERED USERS. 
AND I REPEAT: UKNREGSITERED UNPAID USERS DO NOT GET ACTUAL PRODUCT FROM THE APP; 
THEY OLNLY GET PREVIEWS OF PRODUCT, ALBEIT PREIVEWS OF ACTUAL PRODUCT 
(WHICH AS SUCH WERE GENERAETD BY REAL API CALLS). DO YOU UNDERSTAND ALL THIS?
