DOCUMENT TITLE: Comprehensive Mind Map Functionality Specification for Replit Agent
________________________________________
I. Mind Map Types: Definitions + Examples
1. Radial Mind Map (Classic)
•	Structure: Central concept in the middle; ideas branch out radially.
•	Purpose: Idea generation, concept expansion.
•	Example Input Text: > “Language is central to philosophy. It allows expression of thoughts, clarification of meaning, and transmission of knowledge.”
•	Corresponding Radial Map:
o	Central: Language
	Expression of thoughts
	Clarification of meaning
	Transmission of knowledge
2. Tree (Hierarchical) Mind Map
•	Structure: Top-down, parent → child → sub-child.
•	Purpose: Show structure, organization, argument flow.
•	Example Input Text: > “Philosophy splits into metaphysics and epistemology. Metaphysics includes ontology and cosmology. Epistemology includes empiricism and rationalism.”
•	Tree Map:
o	Philosophy
	Metaphysics
•	Ontology
•	Cosmology
	Epistemology
•	Empiricism
•	Rationalism
3. Flowchart Map
•	Structure: Linear or branched flow of steps; process-based.
•	Purpose: Show causality or sequences.
•	Example: > “Input → Process → Output.”
•	Map:
o	Input → Process → Output
4. Concept Map
•	Structure: Web of related concepts with labeled relationships.
•	Purpose: Highlight conceptual connections.
•	Example: > “Wittgenstein’s Tractatus relates language to reality, thought, and logic. Logic determines valid expression.”
•	Map:
o	Tractatus — relates to → Language, Reality, Thought
o	Logic — determines → Valid expression
5. Argument Map
•	Structure: Premises, objections, rebuttals, conclusions.
•	Purpose: Analyze reasoning.
•	Example: > “The world is the totality of facts, not things. Therefore, language must express facts. Objection: some language is fictional. Rebuttal: fictional statements simulate fact-structure.”
•	Map:
o	Claim: World = facts
	Therefore → Language = fact-expression
	Objection → Fictional language exists
	Rebuttal → Fiction simulates facts

II. Universal Mind Map Generator Requirements
Replit must implement a dynamic, flexible mind map system with the following features:
1. Map Type Selection
•	User can select from:
o	Radial
o	Tree
o	Flowchart
o	Concept
o	Argument
•	The map type must be selectable before or after generating the first version.
2. Source Text Selection
User can: - Highlight any text on screen and generate a mind map just for that portion. - OR choose chunks from a popup list of auto-chunked segments (e.g., from LLM chunking engine).
There are no size presets (e.g., micro/meso/macro); the user defines the scope.
3. Recursivity (Regenerative Mind Mapping)
•	Inside the mind map popup, the user must have the option to:
o	Give written feedback or clarifications (text box)
o	Ask to refine or regenerate the map based on critique
o	Continue recursively until satisfied
4. Output Options
•	The mind map must be downloadable as:
o	JPG
o	PNG
o	PDF
•	The user must also be able to send it via email using SendGrid integration
5. Technical Implementation Notes
•	Use libraries like vis.js, react-flow, cytoscape.js, or equivalent for visual generation.
•	All visuals must render dynamically in-browser with full interactivity (zoom, drag, node click).
•	Edge labels must be supported (e.g., “supports,” “contradicts”).
•	Style nodes by function: Central / Supporting / Objection / Example / Implication

Summary
This document defines all supported mind map types with real examples and specifies a flexible, recursive, user-controlled mind map system for integration into the Living Book app and other contexts. All outputs must be exportable and user-modifiable. Recursive feedback is required to ensure quality.
No hardcoded scale limits. No flattened box layouts. This must be a genuine visual mapping system that helps the user see and refine conceptual structure.
