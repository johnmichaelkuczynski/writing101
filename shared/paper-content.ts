      content: "Mathematics is a study which, when we start from its most familiar portions, may be pursued in either of two opposite directions. The more familiar direction is constructive, towards gradually increasing complexity: from integers to fractions, real numbers, complex numbers; from addition and multiplication to differentiation and integration, and on to higher mathematics. The other direction, which is less familiar, proceeds, by analysing, to greater and greater abstractness and logical simplicity; instead of asking what can be defined and deduced from what is assumed to begin with, we ask instead what more general ideas and principles can be found, in terms of which what was our starting-point can be defined or deduced.\n\nIt is the fact of pursuing this opposite direction that characterises mathematical philosophy as opposed to ordinary mathematics. But it should be understood that the distinction is one, not in the subject matter, but in the state of mind of the investigator. Early Greek geometers, passing from the empirical rules of Egyptian land-surveying to the general propositions by which those rules were found to be justifiable, and thence to Euclid's axioms and postulates, were engaged in mathematical philosophy, according to the above definition; but when once the axioms and postulates had been reached, their deductive employment, as we find it in Euclid, belonged to mathematics in the ordinary sense.\n\nThe distinction between mathematics and mathematical philosophy is one which depends upon the interest inspiring the research, and upon the stage which the research has reached; not upon the propositions with which the research is concerned.\n\nWe may state the same distinction in another way. The most obvious and easy things in mathematics are not those that come logically at the beginning; they are things that, from the point of view of logical deduction, come somewhere in the middle. Just as the easiest bodies to see are those that are neither very near nor very far, neither very small nor very great, so the easiest conceptions to grasp are those that are neither very complex nor very simple (using \"simple\" in a logical sense).\n\nAnd as we need two sorts of instruments, the telescope and the microscope, for the enlargement of our visual powers, so we need two sorts of instruments for the enlargement of our logical powers, one to take us forward to the higher mathematics, the other to take us backward to the logical foundations of the things that we are inclined to take for granted in mathematics. We shall find that by analysing our ordinary mathematical notions we acquire fresh insight, new powers, and the means of reaching whole new mathematical subjects by adopting fresh lines of advance after our backward journey.\n\nTo the average educated person of the present day, the obvious starting-point of mathematics would be the series of whole numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... and it is this series that we shall mean when we speak of the \"series of natural numbers.\"\n\nIt is only at a high stage of civilisation that we could take this series as our starting-point. It must have required many ages to discover that a brace of pheasants and a couple of days were both instances of the number 2: the degree of abstraction involved is far from easy. And the discovery that 1 is a number must have been difficult. As for 0, it is a very recent addition; the Greeks and Romans had no such digit.\n\nBut though familiar, they are not understood. Very few people are prepared with a definition of what is meant by \"number,\" or \"0,\" or \"1.\" It is not very difficult to see that, starting from 0, any other of the natural numbers can be reached by repeated additions of 1, but we shall have to define what we mean by \"adding 1,\" and what we mean by \"repeated.\" These questions are by no means easy."

      title: "Chapter 2: Definition of Number",
      content: "All traditional pure mathematics, including analytical geometry, may be regarded as consisting wholly of propositions about the natural numbers. That is to say, the terms which occur can be defined by means of the natural numbers, and the propositions can be deduced from the properties of the natural numbers—with the addition, in each case, of the ideas and propositions of pure logic.\n\nThat all traditional pure mathematics can be derived from the natural numbers is a fairly recent discovery, though it had long been suspected. Pythagoras, who believed that not only mathematics, but everything else could be deduced from numbers, was the discoverer of the most serious obstacle in the way of what is called the \"arithmetising\" of mathematics. It was Pythagoras who discovered the existence of incommensurables, and, in particular, the incommensurability of the side of a square and the diagonal.\n\nIf the length of the side is $1$ inch, the number of inches in the diagonal is $\\sqrt{2}$, which appeared not to be a number at all. The problem thus raised was solved only in our own day, and was only solved completely by the help of the reduction of arithmetic to logic, which will be explained in following chapters.\n\nHaving reduced all traditional pure mathematics to the theory of the natural numbers, the next step in logical analysis was to reduce this theory itself to the smallest set of premises and undefined terms from which it could be derived. This work was accomplished by Peano. He showed that the entire theory of the natural numbers could be derived from three primitive ideas and five primitive propositions in addition to those of pure logic.\n\nThese three ideas and five propositions thus became, as it were, hostages for the whole of traditional pure mathematics. If they could be defined and proved in terms of others, so could all pure mathematics. Their logical \"weight,\" if one may use such an expression, is equal to that of the whole series of sciences that have been deduced from the theory of the natural numbers.\n\nThe three primitive ideas in Peano's arithmetic are: 0, number, successor.\n\nBy \"successor\" he means the next number in the natural order. That is to say, the successor of 0 is 1, the successor of 1 is 2, and so on. By \"number\" he means, in this connection, the class of the natural numbers. He is not assuming that we know all the members of this class, but only that we know what we mean when we say that this or that is a number.\n\nThe five primitive propositions which Peano assumes are:\n\n(1) 0 is a number.\n(2) The successor of any number is a number.\n(3) No two numbers have the same successor.\n(4) 0 is not the successor of any number.\n(5) Any property which belongs to 0, and also to the successor of every number which has the property, belongs to all numbers.\n\nThe last of these is the principle of mathematical induction. We shall have much to say concerning mathematical induction in the sequel; for the present, we are concerned with it only as it occurs in Peano's analysis of arithmetic."

      title: "Chapter 3: Finitude and Mathematical Induction",
      content: "Let us consider briefly the kind of way in which the theory of the natural numbers results from Peano's three ideas and five propositions. To begin with, we define $1$ as \"the successor of $0$,\" $2$ as \"the successor of $1$,\" and so on. We can obviously go on as long as we like with these definitions, since, in virtue of proposition (2), every number that we reach will have a successor, and, in virtue of (3), this cannot be any of the numbers already defined, because, if it were, two different numbers would have the same successor; and in virtue of (4) none of the numbers we reach in the series of successors can be $0$.\n\nThus the series of successors gives us an endless series of continually new numbers. In virtue of (5) all numbers come in this series, which begins with $0$ and travels on through successive successors: for (a) $0$ belongs to this series, and (b) if a number $n$ belongs to it, so does its successor, whence, by mathematical induction, every number belongs to the series.\n\nSuppose we wish to define the sum of two numbers. Taking any number $m$, we define $m + 0 = m$, and $m + (n + 1) = \\text{successor}(m + n)$. In virtue of (5) this gives a definition of the sum of $m$ and $n$, whatever number $n$ may be. Similarly we can define the product of any two numbers.\n\nThe principle of mathematical induction, which is our fifth primitive proposition, plays a very important part, not only in the theory of numbers, but throughout mathematics. It is in virtue of this principle that we are able to prove general propositions about all numbers, although we cannot enumerate all numbers individually. The principle may be stated as follows:\n\n**Mathematical Induction Principle**: Any property $P$ which belongs to $0$, and also to the successor of every number which has the property, belongs to all numbers. Formally:\n\n$$\\text{If } P(0) \\text{ and } \\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}[P(n) \\Rightarrow P(n+1)], \\text{ then } \\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}[P(n)]$$\n\nThis principle is really a definition of the class of natural numbers. When we have defined $0$ and \"successor,\" we wish to define the \"natural numbers\" as the class consisting of $0$ and all the numbers that can be reached from $0$ by successive applications of the operation \"successor.\" But \"can be reached\" is a phrase which is not free from ambiguity. The inductive definition is precise: the natural numbers are all those numbers that possess every property possessed by $0$ and by the successors of all numbers that possess the property."

      title: "Chapter 4: The Definition of Order",
      content: "It is time now to turn to the considerations which make it necessary to advance beyond the standpoint of Peano, who represents the last perfection of the \"arithmetisation\" of mathematics, to that of Frege, who first succeeded in \"logicising\" mathematics, i.e. in reducing to logic the arithmetical notions which his predecessors had shown to be sufficient for mathematics.\n\nIn the first place, Peano's three primitive ideas—namely, \"0,\" \"number,\" and \"successor\"—are capable of an infinite number of different interpretations, all of which will satisfy the five primitive propositions. We will give some examples.\n\n(1) Let \"0\" be taken to mean 100, and let \"number\" be taken to mean the numbers from 100 onward in the series of natural numbers. Then all our primitive propositions are satisfied, even the fourth, for though 100 is the successor of 99, 99 is not a \"number\" in the sense which we are now giving to the word \"number.\" It is obvious that any number may be substituted for 100 in this example.\n\n(2) Let \"0\" mean the number 0, let \"number\" mean what we usually call \"even numbers,\" and let the \"successor\" of a number be what results from adding 2 to it. Then \"1\" will stand for the number 2, \"2\" will stand for the number 4, and so on; the series of \"numbers\" now will be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... All Peano's five primitive propositions will be satisfied still.\n\n(3) Let \"0\" have its usual meaning, but let \"number\" mean what we call \"finite numbers,\" i.e. the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, ... n, and let \"successor\" have its usual meaning. Then all the primitive propositions will be satisfied.\n\nThese examples suffice to show that the primitive ideas of Peano's arithmetic are undetermined by his primitive propositions. This means that arithmetic, as he sets it forth, is not \"categorical.\" It does not determine uniquely a set of entities about which it is speaking; it merely describes a certain structure which many different sets of entities may have.\n\nThis is not a defect in Peano; on the contrary, it represents the essence of pure mathematics. But it does show that we must not suppose ourselves to know what arithmetic is about merely because we have an arithmetical system."

      id: "kinds-relations",
      title: "Chapter 5: Kinds of Relations",
      content: "A relation is a property which may belong to certain couples, triads, tetrads, etc., of terms. For instance, the relation \"greater\" belongs to the couple (3, 2) and to the couple (5, 4), but not to the couple (2, 3) or to the couple (3, 3). Relations of couples are called dyadic relations or relations with two terms; relations of triads are called triadic relations or relations with three terms; and so on. We shall be concerned, for the present, only with dyadic relations.\n\nA relation R is said to hold between two terms x and y when (x, y) is a couple to which the relation belongs; in such a case, we say that x has the relation R to y. We may denote this by xRy.\n\nThe domain of a relation R consists of all those terms which have the relation R to something. The converse domain consists of all those terms to which something has the relation R. The field of a relation consists of its domain and converse domain together.\n\nA relation is said to be reflexive if every term in its field has that relation to itself. For instance, the relation \"not greater than\" is reflexive among numbers, because every number is not greater than itself.\n\nA relation is said to be symmetrical if, whenever x has the relation to y, then y has the relation to x. For instance, the relation \"equal to\" is symmetrical.\n\nA relation is said to be transitive if, whenever x has the relation to y and y has the relation to z, then x has the relation to z. For instance, the relation \"greater than\" is transitive.\n\nA relation which is reflexive, symmetrical, and transitive is called an equivalence-relation. The most important example of an equivalence-relation is equality.\n\nA relation is said to be asymmetrical if, whenever x has the relation to y, then y does not have the relation to x. For instance, the relation \"father of\" is asymmetrical.\n\nA relation is said to be connected if, given any two different terms in its field, one of them has the relation to the other. For instance, among numbers, the relation \"less than\" is connected, because, given any two different numbers, one is less than the other.\n\nA relation which is asymmetrical and transitive is called a serial relation or an ordering relation. If it is also connected, it is called a connected series.\n\nThese definitions show the importance of considering relations systematically. Many mathematical concepts which at first sight appear quite different prove to be instances of the same logical pattern when viewed in terms of relations."

      title: "Chapter 6: Similarity of Relations",
      content: "Two relations are said to be similar when the same map which correlates the field of the one to the field of the other also correlates the relation itself to the other relation. This is a very important notion, and we must spend some time in making it clear.\n\nSuppose we have two classes, say the class of men and the class of women, and suppose we have a relation which correlates the men one to one with the women—say the relation of marriage in a country where monogamy is universal. Then the men and women are \"similar.\" But we can say more: if R is the relation of husband and wife, then R correlates men with women. If we now consider the relation \"brother\" among men and the relation \"sister\" among women, we find that they are \"similar\" in structure.\n\nMore precisely: Let P be the class of men, Q the class of women, and let R be the relation of marriage, which correlates every man with exactly one woman. Let S be the relation \"brother\" among men, and let T be the relation \"sister\" among women. Then S and T are similar if, whenever two men are brothers, their wives are sisters, and conversely.\n\nThis notion of similarity is fundamental to the whole study of series and order. When two relations are similar, they have the same \"structure,\" though they may have quite different fields. Two series are similar when their generating relations are similar.\n\nThe importance of this concept lies in the fact that all the formal properties of a relation depend only upon its structure, not upon the particular terms which compose its field. Thus, if we know that a relation R is transitive and asymmetrical and connected, we know that any relation similar to R will also be transitive and asymmetrical and connected.\n\nThis is the reason why pure mathematics can be applied to so many different subject-matters. The mathematical properties of a system depend only upon the logical form of the system, not upon its particular content. Whenever we have two similar systems, whatever is true of the logical form of the one will be true of the logical form of the other.\n\nThe notion of similarity enables us to define what we mean by saying that two collections have the same number of terms, without having first to define what we mean by \"number.\" Two collections have the same number of terms when there is a one-one relation whose domain is one collection and whose converse domain is the other. This is a purely logical definition, involving no mathematical ideas beyond those of logic."

      id: "rational-real-complex",
      title: "Chapter 7: Rational, Real, and Complex Numbers",
      content: "The extension from natural numbers to fractions, or rational numbers, is a familiar process. We naturally think of a fraction as composed of two integers written one above the other with a line between them. But when we ask what a fraction is, we find difficulties analogous to those we found concerning negative numbers.\n\nThe problem is that 2/3, 4/6, 6/9, 8/12, etc., are all the same fraction, though they are different pairs of integers. We must therefore ask: What relation among ratios makes them represent the same rational number?\n\nTwo ratios m/n and p/q represent the same rational number when mq = np. Thus 2/3 and 4/6 represent the same rational number because 2×6 = 3×4.\n\nSo a rational number is not a pair of integers, but an infinite class of pairs of integers, namely all those pairs which are equivalent in the sense that cross-multiplication gives the same result.\n\nThe theory of real numbers is more difficult. A real number is most easily conceived as the limit approached by a series of rational numbers. For example, the square root of 2 can be defined as the limit of the series 1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, 1.4142, ... where each term is a rational approximation to √2, and the terms get closer and closer to some definite value.\n\nBut this raises the question: What is a limit? A limit is not itself a member of the series which approaches it; √2 is not a rational number, though it is approached by rational numbers. We must therefore give a purely logical definition of what we mean by the limit of a series.\n\nThis is done by means of the notion of a \"segment\" of rationals. The real number √2 is defined as the class of all rationals whose square is less than 2, together with all rationals that are less than any rational whose square is less than 2.\n\nComplex numbers introduce the \"imaginary\" unit i, defined as √(-1). A complex number has the form a + bi where a and b are real numbers. These numbers, which seem to involve a kind of logical impossibility, prove to be not only consistent but also extremely useful in mathematics.\n\nThe justification of complex numbers is that they make algebra more systematic. Every algebraic equation of degree n has exactly n roots when complex numbers are admitted. The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every polynomial equation with complex coefficients has at least one complex root.\n\nThus we see that the extension from natural numbers through rationals and reals to complex numbers is governed throughout by logical considerations. Each extension is made in order to preserve some important formal property or to make some class of operations always possible."

      id: "mathematics-logic",
      title: "Chapter 18: Mathematics and Logic",
      content: "The question of the relation between mathematics and logic is one which has only recently begun to be adequately treated. It was generally supposed that mathematics and logic were quite distinct studies. Logic was concerned with the general rules of inference, while mathematics dealt with numbers and spatial relations. But this view has been found to be untenable.\n\nIn the first place, the methods of proof employed in mathematics are the same as those employed in logic. Mathematical reasoning is deductive, and proceeds according to precisely the same logical rules as any other deductive science. There is no peculiar mathematical logic distinct from general logic.\n\nIn the second place, when we examine what mathematics actually proves, we find that its propositions are not about numbers and spatial relations in the sense in which they are commonly understood. The numbers and points and lines of mathematics are not particular entities with which we are acquainted, but are variables satisfying certain logical conditions.\n\nWhen we define the number 3, we do not point to some particular collection of three things. We define 3 as the class of all triads—that is, as the class of all classes that are similar to the class consisting of three particular objects. This definition involves only logical notions.\n\nSimilarly, when we prove that 2 + 2 = 4, we are not asserting anything about particular collections, but about all collections of a certain logical type. The proposition is really a logical consequence of our definitions.\n\nThe traditional logic, which dealt mainly with the syllogism, was far too narrow in its scope. Modern logic, as developed by such men as Boole, Schröder, Peano, and Frege, is much more comprehensive, and is capable of expressing all the forms of reasoning employed in mathematics.\n\nThe result of this development is that the distinction between mathematics and logic has become largely conventional. We may regard pure mathematics as consisting of all the logical consequences of certain logical principles, or we may regard logic as including all those principles from which pure mathematics can be deduced.\n\nThis view, that mathematics is logic, is called logicism. It means that every mathematical concept can be defined in terms of logical concepts, and every mathematical proposition can be proved from logical premises. The proof of this thesis was the main achievement of Principia Mathematica.\n\nThe importance of this result can hardly be overestimated. It shows that mathematics, so far from being a collection of mysterious truths about numbers and space, is simply an extension of logic. All mathematical knowledge is really logical knowledge, and differs from other logical knowledge only in degree of complexity."
